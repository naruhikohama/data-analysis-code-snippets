# Helpful code snippets here for data analysis
I work with data analysis daily. I seek for help on stackoverflow daily, sometimes chatGPT as well. 

Sometimes I can't find the answer in just one source, so to help myself in the future and others that come by this repo, I will compile many useful codes here.

I will create (and try to keep it organized) many code snippets and show what they can do.

I used to work with R, so I kinda got used to the way you code with dplyr and the pipe operator. I will bring some code snippets in python for those in similar situation.
