# Helpful R snippets here
I work with R daily. I seek for help on stackoverflow daily. 

Sometimes I can't find the answer in just one source, so to help myself in the future and others that come by this repo, I will compile many useful codes here.

I will create (and try to keep it organized) many code snippets and show what they can do.
